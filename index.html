                <p>The foreign language that I would like to learn is Chinese because
                    I think Chinese language is the most unique since I have already learned the basic.
                    Chinese (Mandarin) still holds the top position as the most used mother tongue.It is
                    considered one of the hardest languages to learn. Chinese has different calligraphy styles.
                    Chinese has the most similar sounding words.</p>
